# Ruboids

Ruboids is a [Boids Algorithm Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) made using [Ruby2D](http://www.ruby2d.com), [FelFlame](https://github.com/realtradam/FelFlame) and [Ruby2D-Camera](https://github.com/realtradam/ruby2d-camera)

![Ruboid Example](https://naked.catgirls.rodeo/images/ruboid-example.gif)

## How to Play

### Without Bundler
once you gem install `ruby2d`, `felflame`, and `ruby2d-camera` simple do `ruby run.rb`

### Using Bundler
`bundler install` followed by `bundler exec ruby run.rb`

## Controls
Left click on the screen to create a Piranha.  
Right Click and drag to move the camera. (`w` `a` `s` `d` works as well)  
Scrollwheel to zoom. (`z` and `x` work as well) 

## Playing around with the parameters
All the parameters you can change are nicely stored inside the `SingletomConfig` component in the `$config` variable in `run.rb` so it is easy to quickly and easily change and play around with them.

## Purpose
I made this to stress test my new framework FelFlame and see how it is, and it was really nice and easy making this game so I will probably continue to use it for future projects. Also just I wanted to play around with boids. üòÅ
